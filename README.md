## introduction

Welcome to `gowitness` version *3*! This is a significant rewrite of the original `gowitness`.

`gowitness` is a website screenshot utility written in Golang, that uses Chrome Headless to generate screenshots of web interfaces using the command line, with a handy report viewer to process results. Both Linux and macOS is supported, with Windows support mostly working.

Inspiration for `gowitness` comes from [Eyewitness](https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/EyeWitness). If you are looking for something with lots of extra features, be sure to check it out along with these [other](https://github.com/afxdub/http-screenshot-html) [projects](https://github.com/breenmachine/httpscreenshot).
